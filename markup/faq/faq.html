                Q: Are your products 100% manufactured by Boosted?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: Yup, we acquired everything that Boosted had, and it came
                direct from them.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Q: What if something says out of stock?</summary>
              <p>
                A: We are absolutely not permitted to create new products for /
                by Boosted because their IP was sold off. We can only sell the
                rest of the stock that we have. Supplies are extremely limited,
                this is the last of Boosted's stock and when it's gone it's gone
                forever. Once something says sold out, that is it, you will not
                be able to get it again.

              <summary>Q: Who pays for shipping?</summary>
              <p>
                USA answer: We will pay for shipping on anything over $100. If
                you need something repaired you will be required to pay for
                shipping both ways. If your board requires a warranty part we
                will do our best to ship you a replacement part on us to get you
                back up and rolling.
              </p>
              <p>Canadian answer: Please see <a href="#">shipping page</a></p>

              </summary>
              <p>
                A: We are located in San Francisco, CA and are not open to the
                public.

                Can you hook me up?

              <p>
                A: We are now shipping to Canada! We are actively trying to go
                more international, please keep an eye on our instagram

                Q: I am going to use a freight forwarder. What happens if they
                can not forward the order because of a battery or other issue?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: Regardless of us warning people, some people have tried to
                use a freight forwarder to order boards and scooters. If your
                board or scooter gets rejected and returned to us, we will
                refund you - $200 / unit, to cover our shipping and rerouting
                fees. (Yes it costs us approximately $200 when your order gets
                rejected)

            <details>
              <summary>Q: How about Alaska or Hawaii?</summary>
              <p>
                A: As much as we would like to ship to you, Fedex and UPS are
                very specific about our batteries traveling on airplanes so we
                can not ship to either of those states.

                Q: What happens to me if I already own a Boosted Board with a
                warranty?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: We are not Boosted Boards. Unfortunately Boosted went
                bankrupt and from what we've seen older warranty claims are
                being ignored
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Q: Then who are you guys?</summary>
              <p>
                A: We are the guys who bought all of the remaining inventory
                from Boosted after they shut their doors.

                Q: What does that mean for me? Can I still get service for my
                Board / Rev?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: We cannot honor warranties for items bought from Boosted
                because they are a different company. We can absolutely help you
                with service. If there is something that you need from us,
                belts, chargers, advice, please feel free to reach out to us:
                <a href="#">info@boostednepal.com</a> and we will do the best we

                Q: So if I have a warranty/repair issue with a board/scooter I
                already own I'm totally screwed?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: On the one hand, yes; when Boosted went bankrupt it appears
                that your claims to free replacements/repairs may have gone up
                in smoke. That being said, we understand the frustration you may
                feel and we want to do what we can to help. Email us at
                <a href="#">info@boostednepal.com</a> and let us know what's
                going on and we'll do our best to sort you out as fairly as
                possible, just remember that we are a different company and had
                nothing to do with your original purchase so if we don't hand
                you a new board please don't yell at us.

                Q: If I buy something from you, what sort of warranty do I have?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A: We have a limited 60 day warranty for everything you receive.
                This covers you for manufacturers defects out of the box. If you
                receive a product that you believe is defective please contact
                us immediately and do not use your product. Please include your
                serial number (if applicable) and a photo or video demonstrating
                the problem and email it to:
                <a href="#">info@boostednepal.com</a> If we decide your issue
                needs inspection or replacement we will provide you with an RA
                number that must be attached to any items shipped back to us.
              </p>

              <p>
                A. That's not a question but you should know that we're
                continuing to receive boxes of goods and as we find items we
                will be adding them to our website for sale. Please keep an eye

              </summary>
              <p>
                A. We hope so but again, we're unboxing products as fast as we
                can. We expect to see more of these items and we will add them
                to the site as soon as we do. In the meantime make sure to add

                specialists can best assist you. Unfortunately, we're not able
                to repair boards, however we are able to provide you with
                pointers and sell you spare parts that will get your board up
                and going. Please email us and we'll do our best to help you
